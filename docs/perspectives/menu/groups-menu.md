# Groups 

The **GROUPS** menu deploys when clicking on the first button of the left menu. It collapses when clicking again.

## Select
*	This menu lets you launch a new group from a subset of data chosen in the **_Categories_** **(2)** section.
*	When clicking the header of a category, it expands and shows the fields used - these are the criteria for generating new groups. By default, they are all selected.
*	When clicking **_Select all_**, all options are (de)selected, depending on whether they were previously selected or not. 
*	You can (de)select options by clicking them.

:::warning
It is mandatory to include at least one field per category, otherwise the name of the category will be highlighted in red.
:::

## Execute
*	To run the new group, you have to click the **_Run new group_** button at **(1)**. This new group will be shown in a new tab (top), with its name representing the selected categories and options.
*	If the new tab is closed, and can only be recovered by launching it again.
*	Next to the name of each category there is an icon. Clicking on it, a new tab is automatically launched for each of the options selected in that category.
*	The **PROCESS** tab shows the process view generated from the data defined in the runner. This tab can be closed, and can be recovered by: Selecting all options, and clicking **_Run new group_**. This will add a new tab called **PROCESS**, which shows the process view generated from all the data again.

:::warning 
Every time a new group is launched, the statistics (both from each group and the global ones) will be automatically recalculated.

## Extract

*	There is also the possibility of extracting the new group. This means that, when running the group with the **_Extract group_** button, a new PMApp window will open. These two experiments will be totally independent.

## Delete

*   The **_Delete groups_** button clears the options selected in **_Categories_**.

:::info
The tabs can be renamed. This can be done from the top menu in each process view (each tab), clicking on the info button.
