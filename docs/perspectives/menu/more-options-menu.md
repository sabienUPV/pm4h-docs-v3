# More Options 

The **MORE OPTIONS** menu accesses information related to the experiment.

## Save experiment

This menu allows saving the current experiment as a runner file in format "rnr.zip". This generates a file that saves the experiment configuration, the generated process views, and some pre-calculated data to speed up the loading process next time it is run.

## Experiment configuration

This option opens a new perspective that displays the name of the experiment, description, and path to the used resources, as well as the data files (when this information is available).
