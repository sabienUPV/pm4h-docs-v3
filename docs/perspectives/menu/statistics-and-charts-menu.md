*   There, you have to select the following:
    * The value you want to represent (**_Value_**).
    *   The type of representation (**_Representation_**); which can be in the form of a column chart, pie, table or histogram depending on the type of value chosen in the previous step.
    *   The information displayed; which can be in absolute values ​​(**_Value_**), local percentage (**_Local View Percentage_**) or global percentage (**_Global percentage_**).
    * Whether the scope of the chart should be limited to the active process view or taking into account all of the present tabs.
*   Values ​​of type text can be represented in graphs (types: columns, pie and table).
    * In the case of the columns chart, a density line can be shown by checking the option **_Show density line_**.
    * In the pie chart, % can be grouped into a group that will be called OTHER, this will happen when filling in the minimum threshold option (**_Minimum Threshold __%_**)
*   Values ​​of type numeric can be represented in graphs such as histograms or tables.

## Add advanced charts (2)

*   You can add an advanced chart by clicking on the **_Add advanced charts_** button. This action will open a wizard that will guide us through the process (figure 3).

*   There, you have to select the type of representation you want (**_Representation_**), this variable depending on the type of information you have in **_Values_**, where they will all appear selected by default.
*   The last step to add the graphic is to click the _**Accept**_ button.

## Templates (3) 

You can also create templates (**_templates_**) so that in future experiments we can show the same graphics that we have saved as a template in a more agile way.

*   Templates can be created, loaded and deleted, for which the corresponding option must be chosen (**_Load, Delete, Create_**).
*   When creating them, you must indicate a name and a description that later helps us identify the type of graphics that we have included.
*   Then click on the **_Accept_** button.

Each graph (columns, table...) has a menu available that is visible when hovering the mouse over the upper right corner (as shown in figure 5), and (where possible):

*   Export to PNG
*   Export the data to a CSV file
*   Autoscale the chart to fit the available space
*   Remove from current window

The represented graphics allow to:

* Consult a specific value represented in the chart by clicking with the left mouse button on the corresponding area,
* Scrolling the graph to the left or right by holding **right click**,
* With **Ctrl + right click**, it allows to select an area to zoom in, or you can also zoom in and out directly with **Ctrl + mouse wheel**. To restore the original size of the graph, as mentioned above, click on the **_Autoscale_** button available at the top right of the box for each graph.
* In addition, in column charts, if not all fit in the chart, the message **_Move to see all the columns_** will be displayed, allowing you to move to the right and left of the chart to see the rest of columns. This is done by clicking with the mouse on the surface of the graph and then scrolling with the keyboard cursors, keeping in mind that clicking the cursor to the right will show the columns to the left and clicking the cursor to on the left, the columns on the right will be displayed.
* When changing tabs, the graphs will be updated showing information related to that process view.
