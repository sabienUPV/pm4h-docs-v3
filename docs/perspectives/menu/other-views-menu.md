# Other Views 

The **OTHER VIEWS** will deploy when clicking the fourth button in the left menu. It collapses when clicking again.

## Clustering

This menu displays as many collapsible sections as perspectives. In this case there is only **_Clustering_ (1)**. It groups data according to the chosen criteria **(2)** and parameter configuration **(3)**.

*	The available criteria are the so-called distance algorithms (**_Distance type_**), which can be:
    *	**_Topological_**, which only accounts for the shape of the process view.
	*   **_Heuristic_**, which accounts for the time spent in each event in addition to the shape of the process view.
	*   **_Levenshtein_**, which does not generalize, does not account for autocycles but does account for the order of execution of events.
*	Once parameters are configured **(2)**, you can click the **_Run clustering_** button.
*	This will open a new tab with the **Clustering** perspective. For more information check [Clustering perspective](../clustering-perspective.md).
