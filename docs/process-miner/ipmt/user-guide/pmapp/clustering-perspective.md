# Clustering perspective

**CLUSTERING** is a perspective that groups data and generates different process views (or groups), as shown in figure 60.

*	These prove views display the same options as the ones described in [Main screen](./intro.md).
*	It contains an **_Enhancement_** menu, similar to that of **MAIN** perspective (check [Enhancements menu](./menu/enhancement-menu.md)), that applies changes to all process views in the **clustering**.
*	In addition to the options already introduced in such menu, in the process views generated during **clustering** you can edit the name by clicking the pencil icon **(1)**. The name that appears by default corresponds to a generic name made up of «Log», followed by the group number which is «Log_3» and the number of traces that make up said group «Log_3_106».
*   The process views will be presented in a 2x2 grid. If there were more process views, they would be distributed in grids of 4, being able to navigate between them by clicking on the numbers located at the bottom **(2)**. Although this setting can be changed with the third menu option **_Change number of elements per page_**. Each time this option is clicked, the number of groups visible per screen is changed from 2x2 to 3x3 to 4x4 to 6x6 to 1x1.

*	The second button in the menu (figure 61) allows saving each of the process views as a new category for the **MAIN** perspective (figure 62) (check [Groups menu](./menu/groups-menu.md)).
*	Figure 63 shows how the new category and groups have been added.
*	You can edit the names of the groups (the process views generated during **_Clustering_**) and add them as a new category to the **GROUPS** menu, as many times as you want.
