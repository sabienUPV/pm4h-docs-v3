# Main window

The first PMApp screen is shown after running an experiment. This screen is divided into three main areas:

![main window](/img/pantalla-principal.png "main window")

Figure 1. First PMApp screen after running an experiment

* **(1) Top toolbar.** The name of the experiment appears to the left of this toolbar, and the application version and Help are placed to the right. Clicking on the Help icon opens an Internet browser. The toolbar also includes the typical minimize, maximize, and close buttons. Closing the experiment will lose any changes made until that moment. To avoid this, read [More Options menu](../perspectives/menu/more-options-menu).

* **(2) Perspectives.** The result of the run experiment appears in the **MAIN** perspective of the lower toolbar.
    * **(2.1) Process Views.** This subarea is **exclusive** to the **MAIN** perspective, which contains as many tabs (top of the screen) as process views of the same type.
        * These process views **can be closed with the button (x) located on the right**.

* **(3) Left menu.** The menu shown in figure 1 is exclusive to the **MAIN** perspective, where the **PROCESS** view is shown by default. Each perspective has its own different menu.

## Different perspectives

The following are the different perspectives in the current version of PMApp. They appear in the bottom-left part of the screen **(2)** as shown in figure 1:

### Main

 It represents process views and contains as many tabs as existing process views. Once an experiment is executed, the **PROCESS** tab shows the process view generated from the data in a runner. For more details, check [Main perspective](../perspectives/main-perspective).

### Progress

This perspective shows the internal actions performed by PMApp. It can be opened by clicking on the gear button on the bottom-right corner.

### Experiment configuration

This perspective displays information about the experiment. It can be opened from the **More Options** menu. For more information check [More options menu](../perspectives/menu/more-options-menu).

### Transition information

This perspective displays information about transitions in the process view. For more information check [Transition Information perspective](../perspectives/transition-information-perspective).

### Node information

This perspective displays information about the nodes of a process view. For more information check [Node Information perspective](../perspectives/node-information-perspective).

### Trace information 

This perspective displays information about the traces of a process view. For more information check [Trace Information perspective](../perspectives/trace-information-perspective).

### Clustering

This perspective finds similarities in data and generates different groups. It is useful when process views are complex and hard to understand (what is known as the **_spaghetti effect_**). For more information check [Clustering perspective](../perspectives/clustering-perspective).
