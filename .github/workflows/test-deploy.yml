  # This is done because cancelled runs are shown as failed in the GitHub UI,
  # which can be misleading, because cancel-in-progress will cancel the previous run
  # if a new one is triggered, and that should not be shown as a failure
  # (and when the PR is re-opened and there are new commits, the workflow is triggered twice,
  # so for that case we need to cancel the extra run, and it should not be shown as a failure)
