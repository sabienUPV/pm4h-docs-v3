## Select
*	This menu lets you launch a new group from a subset of data chosen in the **_Categories_** **(2)** section.
*	When clicking the header of a category, it expands and shows the fields used criteria for generating new groups. By default, they are all selected.
*	When clicking the **_Select all_**, all options are (de)selected, depending on whether they were previously selected or not. 
*	You can (de)select options by clicking them.

:::warning
It is mandatory to include at least one filed per category, otherwise the name of the category will be highlighted in red.
:::

## Execute
*	To run the new group, you have to click the **_Run new group_** button at **(1)**. This new group will be shown in a new tab (top) identified with the same name of the selected categories and options.
*	If the new tab is closed, and can only be recovered by launching it again.
*	Next to the name of each category there is an icon. Clicking on it, a new tab is automatically launched for each of the options selected in that category.
*	The **PROCESS** tab shows the process view generated from the data defined in the runner. This tab can be closed, and can be recovered by: Selecting all options, and clicking **_Run new group_**. This will add a new tab called **PROCESS**, which shows the process view generated from all the data again.

:::warning 
Every time a new group is launched the statistics of each group and the global ones, will be automatically recalculated.

## Extract

*	There is also the possibility of extracting the new group. This means that running the group with the **_Extract group_** button, a new PMApp window will open. These two experiments will be totally independent.

## Delete

*   The **_Delete groups_** button clears the options selected in **_Categories_**.

:::info
The name of the tabs can be renamed. This can be done from the menu in each process view (each tab), clicking on the info button in the menu available in each process view. For more information go to [Main perspective](../main-perspective.md).
